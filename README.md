# Hack School Workshop 3 - React 

We will begin by creating a directory for the client.
 ```
$ mkdir client 
$ cd client
 ```

Inside this directory, we will initialize a node project using npm (or yarn)

```
npm init -y
```
Within our project directory, we will now proceed to create a Next.js app. This can be achieved by running the following command:

npx create-next-app frontend
